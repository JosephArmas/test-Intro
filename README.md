Mark down file:
I have learned that I had to use a personal access token in order to clone / use git commands
- creating a branch 
- pull request
I am still a little confused on how the merging works when I was doing the pull request 
I hope to grow my understand on that subject of pulling/ commiting in a repository to the point where it becomes 2nd nature to me
